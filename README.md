# Energy-Efficient-Home
Design proposed in a Hackathon conducted by Vellore Institute of Technology

**Abstract**
</br>
**Water Heater Control**
</br>
 Getting Temperature Data via TMP36 Sensor. Alert Buzzer and notification message to  the user through WiFi
**Water Transferring Motor Control**
</br>
  Water level is detected using water level detector. No water - Motor turn off - Informed to user through WiFi
**Automatic Gas Leakage Sensors For Cylinder**
</br>
  A Gas Sensor - Fitted with cylinder. If gas leaks, user is notified through buzzer and through text via WiFi
**Fridge Opening Energy Wastage**
</br>
  If fridge opened for a long, energy is wasted. Low cost fridges doesn't have automatic alert. So, alert is provided using Temperature sensor and buzzer.
**Light and Fan Control**
</br>
 If user is entering the room, Both will turn on - PIR Sensor. 
 Fan's speed is controlled through temperature 
 Light's brightness is adjusted in par with sunlight. Power is saved
